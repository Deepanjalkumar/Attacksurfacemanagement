                    /web/subdomain
                    
                    /web/web-service
                    
                    /web/internet-archive
                    
                    /web/crawler
                    
                    /web/all-files
                    
                    /web/cve-paths
                    
                    /web/juicy-paths
                    
                    /web/leaky-misconfigs
                    
                    /web/juicy-paths
                    
                    /network/ipv4
                    
                    It is flexible as you can create your own endpoints
